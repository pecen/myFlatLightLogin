Here all the libraries that are used in the solution are placed, for instance by setting up a nuget configuration file in the solution root directory, i.e. the src folder. This file should be added to the src folder before the solution is created in Visual Studio to make sure every library that is added by Visual Studio when setting up the solution is added to this folder, i.e. the lib folder. See the doc folder for an example of setting up a nuget configuration file.
